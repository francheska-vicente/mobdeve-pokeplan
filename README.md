This application incentivizes users to achieve their goals by adding Pokémon elements to their life: for example, finishing tasks rewards the user with Pokémon Eggs and Rare Candies. Eggs can be hatched by staying focused on a task and avoiding distractions for a certain amount of time while Rare Candies are used to level up and evolve Pokémon. The overall goal of this application is to collect all the available Pokémon, all while helping the user to stay motivated and productive in real life.

## Focus Timer

The user can set a focus timer (in minutes) that would count down to zero. Finishing the time without leaving the application would allow the user to hatch a Pokémon Egg. The longer the timer is, the higher the chance for the user to hatch a rare Pokémon.

Additionally, the user may toggle ‘Deep Focus Mode’ where in addition to not leaving the application, the user may not touch or move the phone. This would also increase the chances of hatching a rare Pokémon.

## Task Planner

The user may view all the tasks that they have added. Users have the choice to see all the pending tasks or to filter the tasks to be shown based on their category. A user may also choose to modify or delete an existing task. 

In creating a task, the user would be asked to provide the name, category, an optional due date, and the priority level of the task. The priority level of a task ranges from 1 (which signifies the most important task) to 5. Finishing a task with a higher priority level would result in better rewards.

## Pokedex

The user would be able to see the list of all available Pokémon in the application. However, they would only be able to view the information of the Pokémon that they already have.

## Pokemon Party
The Pokémon Party is a group of Pokémon that is visible on the Home Screen. These Pokémon can be interacted with, or more specifically, can be fed Rare Candies and Super Candies.

In the absence of the traditional Pokémon battling system, Rare Candies and Super Candies are used to level up and evolve your Pokémon respectively. Ten (10) Rare Candies are used to level up a Pokémon, while only one (1) Super Candy is needed for evolution. Pokémon can only evolve at specific levels, each different per species.
